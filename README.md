# Projects, Scripts and Visualisations for the Azure Kinect DK

This is a collection of the scripts and programs I have built for the Azure Kinect DK, during my 2023 summer lab placement.
The focus is on the Sensor and Body Tracking SDKs, written in C, and the pykinect-azure Python wrapper built for these SDKs, written in Python.

### Azure Kinect DK Project 4
This file contains example code and scripts from the repository of the pykinect-azure library: https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/pyKinectAzure/tree/master/examples.
They cover every function of the Sensor and Body Tracking SDKs, and are a great starting place.

### Azure Kinect DK Project 6
This file contains my own scripts made using the pykinect-azure wrapper.
